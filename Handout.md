## Why Python

Python is a powerful interpreted language that can help automate many tasks. Learning the language can help operators better understand computer logic and develope critical thinking. It can greatly improve the effectiveness of dev-ops and the productivity of operators.

## First Steps

The *Introduction to Python Programming* PCTC course is a good start for those that do not know any python but it does not go into that much depth. So it is good to supplement that training with the following recourses

This website is a great for those with no coding experience and want to take their first steps to learn python. the whole recourse is interactive but the testing of knowledge is a bit easier that what the PCTC recourse offers

## Python 3 > Python 2

You may have noticed that RHEL7 (The OS of most parts of our toolkit) comes with python 2 already install. You will need to install python 3 if you want to run code written for it. python 2 will run some code written for python 3 but many unexpected things can happen when doing so and it is best not to attempt. It should also be known that python 2 is end of life and will no longer be supported starting the year 2020.
