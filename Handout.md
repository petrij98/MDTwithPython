## Python 2 vs Python 3
Even though python 3 is newer then python 2 there is still a good amount of development done in python 2. RHEL7 comes with python 2 already install were as you will need to install python 3 on any RHEL7 installation before using code written for python 3. Python 2 and python 3 both use the same file extension but make sure to alway run scripts in the version of python they were made for as unexpected errors can occur when not doing so.
